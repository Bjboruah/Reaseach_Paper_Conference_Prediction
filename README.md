# Introduction
In the academic community, the acceptance of research papers into conferences is influenced by various factors beyond the core content, such as authors' affiliations, number of references, and readability. This project explores whether these non-core factors can be used to predict the likelihood of a paper being accepted into a conference.

# Modeling Approach
The project employs machine learning algorithms to predict the acceptance of research papers based on non-core content factors. The modeling process includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Detailed explanations and code implementations are provided in the Jupyter notebooks.

# Results
The results of the analysis, including model performance metrics and visualizations, are presented in the Jupyter notebooks. These findings suggest that certain non-core factors may have a significant impact on the likelihood of a paper being accepted into a conference.
